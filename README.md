### Version history
6/15/2023 v0.0.1 release!

6/16/2023 v0.0.2 fixed edge case async behavior conflicting with each other. (gui and game event observer startup were overlapping/conflicting)

6/16/2023 v0.0.3 app is no longer compressed. compression is a common technique for viruses to infiltrate and obfuscate themselves. antivirus scans should have an easier time analyzing this app (and no longer triggering a false positive).
